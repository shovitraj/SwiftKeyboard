Introduction
========================================================
- This word prediction app is a final assignment of the tenth course (Data Science Capstone) in Coursea Data Science Specialization. 
- This course focuses on analyzing a large corpus of text documents to discover the structure in the data and how words are put together to build a predictive model. 
- N-Gram linguistics model was used to build a smart keyboard that predicts the next word based on input of the words. 



Roadmap to the Model 
========================================================
- Getting and cleaning the data:  
-- All the porvided corpus was combined into one      
-- 25% of the corpus was selected for training a model    
- Exploratory Data Analysis:     
-- Frequency of words and their pairs were calculated  
- Modeling:  
-- Quanteda package was used to tokenize the corpus   
-- 1 to 7-gram model was built for word prediction   

    
Algorithm and Prediction
==========================================================
- To improve efficiency, word pairs that appear less than 5 times in the corpus were removed    
- Katz's back-off model was used to predict the next word    
- The model iterates from 7-gram to 1-gram to find matches in the last (n-1) words
- It starts from 7-gram, backs off to 6-gram if there is no prediction. 
- It continues till, it back-off to 1-gram. 
- When the user input is null, the most frequent word 'the' is returned when number of prediction by default is 1

The Shiny App
